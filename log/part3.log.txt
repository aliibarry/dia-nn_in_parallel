DIA-NN 1.8.1 (Data-Independent Acquisition by Neural Networks)
Compiled on Apr 15 2022 08:45:18
Current date and time: Tue Feb 20 15:45:53 2024
Logical CPU cores: 256
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
Min precursor m/z set to 400
Max precursor m/z set to 1200
Min fragment m/z set to 100
Max fragment m/z set to 1700
Thread number set to 128
Maximum number of missed cleavages set to 2
Min peptide length set to 7
Max peptide length set to 50
Min precursor charge set to 2
Max precursor charge set to 4
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 2
Only peaks with correlation sum exceeding 2 will be considered
Peaks with correlation sum below 1 from maximum will not be considered
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
Existing .quant files will be used
A fast algorithm will be used to select the MS2 mass accuracy setting
Mass accuracy will be determined separately for different runs
Scan windows will be inferred separately for different runs
A spectral library will be generated
DIA-NN will optimise the mass accuracy separately for each run in the experiment. This is useful primarily for quick initial analyses, when it is not yet known which mass accuracy setting works best for a particular acquisition scheme.
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:1 
Unless the spectral library specified was created by this version of DIA-NN, it's strongly recommended to specify a FASTA database and use the 'Reannotate' function to allow DIA-NN to identify peptides which can originate from the N/C terminus of the protein: otherwise site localisation might not work properly for modifications of the protein N-terminus or for modifications which do not allow enzymatic cleavage after the modified residue
